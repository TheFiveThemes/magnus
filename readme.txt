== Description ==

Magnus is a photoblogging WordPress theme named after the latin word for Grand. It was made to showcase photos in a big and bold way, making the featured image on each post span the full width of the browser window, paired up with beautiful typography and a precise grid layout.

Designed and developed originally by [Hugo Baeta](http://hugobaeta.com) as part of [The Five Themes](http://thefivethemes.com/themes/magnus) project.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Header and Featured Images =

Magnus was made to take advantage of featured images, it's recommended that you upload higher quality images at least 2000px wide. If no featured image exists, Magnus defaults to it's primary dark color for the background of the header area. You can also upload a Header Image in "Appearence" > "Header Image" to serve as a default for a page, post, or archive without featured image.

= Menu locations =

Magnus supports two theme locations:

* The Primary Sidebar Navigation, that is displayed on the sidebar drawer, shown when clicking the "hamburger" icon on the top-left;

* Header Quick Navigation, that is displayed on the top-left, before the "hamburger" icon. This menu will only display up to three items. If you chose to not add anything there, it won't be displayed.

#Magnus WordPress Theme
Life is Grand, Show it!

Magnus is a photoblogging WordPress theme named after the latin word for Grand. It is made to showcase photos in a big and bold way, making the featured image on each post span the full width of the browser window, paired up with beautiful typography and a precise grid layout.

##Development of the theme:
We use grunt to manage Sass. All you have to do is a quick `npm install` on the project root in terminal, and then just run `grunt` to start watching for changes to the Sass files.

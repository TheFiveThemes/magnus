<p>Life is Grand, Show it!</p>

<p>Magnus is a photoblogging WordPress theme named after the latin word for Grand. It was made to showcase photos in a big and bold way, making the featured image on each post span the full width of the browser window, paired up with beautiful typography and a carefully planned layout.</p>
